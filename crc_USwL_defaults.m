function crc_USwL_defaults
% Set the defaults which are used by the USwL toolbox
%__________________________________________________________________________
%
% If you want to customise some defaults for your installation, do not
% modify this file directly, but create a file named crc_my_USwL_defaults.m
% instead, accessible from MATLAB search path; e.g., it can be saved in
% MATLAB Startup Folder: userhome/Documents/MATLAB
% or with your toolbox folder: userhome/Documents/spm/toolbox/USwLesion
%
% Example: create the following file to change the image file extension:
% ------ file C:\Workspm12\toolbox\USwLesion\crc_USwL_my_defaults.m -------
% global uswl_def
% uswl_def.segment.mrf = 0;
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% crc_USwL_defaults should not be called directly in any script or function
% To get/set the defaults, use crc_uswl_get_defaults.
