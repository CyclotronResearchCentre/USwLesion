  abstract = {Spinal neurodegeneration is an important determinant of disability
	progression in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.
	Advanced imaging techniques, such as single-voxel (1)H-magnetic resonance
	spectroscopy and q-space imaging, have increased pathological specificity
	for neurodegeneration, but are challenging to implement in the spinal
	cord and have yet to be applied in early primary progressive multiple
	sclerosis. By combining these imaging techniques with new clinical
	measures, which reflect spinal cord pathology more closely than conventional
	clinical tests, we explored the potential for spinal magnetic resonance
	spectroscopy and q-space imaging to detect early spinal neurodegeneration
	that may be responsible for clinical disability. Data from 21 patients
	with primary progressive multiple sclerosis within 6 years of disease
	onset, and 24 control subjects were analysed. Patients were clinically
	assessed on grip strength, vibration perception thresholds and postural
	stability, in addition to the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Nine
	Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, Multiple Sclerosis Walking
	Scale-12, and Modified Ashworth Scale. All subjects underwent magnetic
	resonance spectroscopy and q-space imaging of the cervical cord and
	conventional brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T.
	Multivariate analyses and multiple regression models were used to
	assess the differences in imaging measures between groups and the
	relationship between magnetic resonance imaging measures and clinical
	scores, correcting for age, gender, spinal cord cross-sectional area,
	brain T2 lesion volume, and brain white matter and grey matter volume
	fractions. Although patients did not show significant cord atrophy
	when compared with healthy controls, they had significantly lower
	total N-acetyl-aspartate (mean 4.01 versus 5.31 mmol/l, P = 0.020)
	and glutamate-glutamine (mean 4.65 versus 5.93 mmol/l, P = 0.043)
	than controls. Patients showed an increase in q-space imaging-derived
	indices of perpendicular diffusivity in both the whole cord and major
	columns compared with controls (P < 0.05 for all indices). Lower
	total N-acetyl-aspartate was associated with higher disability, as
	assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (coefficient = -0.41,
	0.01 < P < 0.05), Modified Ashworth Scale (coefficient = -3.78, 0.01
	< P < 0.05), vibration perception thresholds (coefficient = -4.37,
	P = 0.021) and postural sway (P < 0.001). Lower glutamate-glutamine
	predicted increased postural sway (P = 0.017). Increased perpendicular
	diffusivity in the whole cord and columns was associated with increased
	scores on the Modified Ashworth Scale, vibration perception thresholds
	and postural sway (P < 0.05 in all cases). These imaging findings
	indicate reduced structural integrity of neurons, demyelination,
	and abnormalities in the glutamatergic pathways in the cervical cord
	of early primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in the absence of
	extensive spinal cord atrophy. The observed relationship between
	imaging measures and disability suggests that early spinal neurodegeneration
	may underlie clinical impairment, and should be targeted in future
	clinical trials with neuroprotective agents to prevent the development
	of progressive disability.},

  year = {2008},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for fully automated multiple sclerosis
	(MS) lesion segmentation in cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
	The algorithm uses the T1-weighted and the fluid attenuation inversion
	recovery scans. It is based the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification
	technique. The data has been acquired at the Children's Hospital
	Boston (CHB) and the University of North Carolina (UNC). Manual segmentations,
	composed by a human expert of the CHB, were used for training of
	the KNN-classification. The method uses voxel location and signal
	intensity information for determination of the probability being
	a lesion per voxel, thus generating probabilistic segmentation images.
	By applying a threshold on the probabilistic images binary segmentations
	are derived. Automatic segmentations were performed on a set of testing
	images, and compared with manual segmentations from a CHB and a UNC
	expert rater. Furthermore, a combined segmentation was composed from
	segmentations from different algorithms, and used for evaluation.
	The proposed method shows good resemblance with the segmentations
	of the CHB rater. High specificity and lower specificity has been
	observed in comparison with the combined segmentations. Over- and
	undersegmentation can be easily corrected in this procedure by varying
	the threshold on the probabilistic segmentation image. The proposed
	method offers an automated and fully reproducible approach that accurate
	and applicable on standard clinical MR images.},

	in underlying tissue microstructure. A linear model was applied to
	the whole brain, including gray/white matter and deep brain structures,
	to determine the global model coefficients. Synthetic R1 values were
	then calculated using these coefficients and compared with the measured

  abstract = {In this paper we report the set-up and results of the Multimodal Brain
	Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized in conjunction
	with the MICCAI 2012 and 2013 conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art
	tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast
	MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated
	by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor
	image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable
	disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor
	sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%-85\%), illustrating the
	difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked
	best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to
	human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked
	in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good
	algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations
	that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating
	remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.
	The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly
	available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking

	the probabilistic atlas of the healthy tissues with a latent atlas

	It delineates lesion areas individually in each channel, allowing
	for differences in lesion appearance across modalities, an important
	feature of many brain tumor imaging sequences. We also propose discriminative

	labels with semantic and biological meaning, such as "tumor core"
	or "fluid-filled structure", but without a one-to-one correspondence
	to the hypo- or hyper-intense lesion areas identified by the generative

	BRATS set of glioma patient scans, and multimodal brain images of
	patients with acute and subacute ischemic stroke. We find the generative
	model that has been designed for tumor lesions to generalize well
	to stroke images, and the extended discriminative -discriminative
	model to be one of the top ranking methods in the BRATS evaluation.},

  abstract = {In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), detection of T2-hyperintense white matter
	(WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial
	criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease.
	Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time
	and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize
	user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated
	lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo
	(GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines
	the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal
	fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity
	distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which
	are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief
	is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring
	voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions.
	This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to
	lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed
	against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our
	algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10
	patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that
	were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands).
	We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing
	(R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to
	6mm). These results require validation with data from other protocols
	based on a conventional FLAIR sequence and a 3D GRE T1-weighted sequence.
	Yet, we believe that our tool allows fast and reliable segmentation
	of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions, which might simplify the quantification
	of lesions in basic research and even clinical trials.},

	disability was associated with low cerebral WM, thalamus, and brainstem
	volumes (partial correlation coefficients ~0.3-0.4) but not with
	low cortical GM volume. Thalamus volumes were inversely correlated

	lower WM volume is associated with greater disability, as might be

	processes, such as tissue damage and repair, that cause both atrophy

	an evaluation of the lesion load in MRI sequences. A lot of automatic
	methods to segment these lesions are available in the literature.
	The MICCAI workshop Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation Challenge
	08 allows to test and compare these algorithms. This paper presents
	a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR
	sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed
	algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and
	T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped.
	A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed
	on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold
	for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing
	operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense
	signals. Global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the
	inter-expert variability (90/100).},

	(two or fewer lesions), and in typical CDMS patients, MRI(pos) (N
	= 20) with lesions, in comparison with healthy control subjects (N
	= 20). In addition, the metabolite concentrations were also correlated
	with extent of brain atrophy measured using Brain Parenchymal Fraction
	(BPF) and severity of the disease measured using 'Multiple Sclerosis
	Severity Score' (MSSS). Elevated concentrations of glutamate and
	glutamine (Glx) were observed in both MS groups (MRI(neg) 8.12 mM,
	p<0.001 and MRI(pos) 7.96 mM p<0.001) compared to controls, 6.76
	mM. Linear regressions of Glx and total creatine (tCr) with MSSS
	were 0.16 +/- 0.06 mM/MSSS (p = 0.02) for Glx and 0.06 +/- 0.03 mM/MSSS
	(p = 0.04) for tCr, respectively. Moreover, linear regressions of
	tCr and myo-Inositol (mIns) with BPF were -6.22 +/- 1.63 mM/BPF (p<0.001)
	for tCr and -7.71 +/- 2.43 mM/BPF (p = 0.003) for mIns. Furthermore,
	the MRI(pos) patients had lower N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartate-glutamate
	(tNA) and elevated mIns concentrations in NAWM compared to both controls
	(tNA: p = 0.04 mIns p<0.001) and MRI(neg) (tNA: p = 0.03 , mIns:
	p = 0.002). The results suggest that Glx may be an important marker
	for pathology in non-lesional white matter in MS. Moreover, Glx is
	related to the severity of MS independent of number of lesions in
	the patient. In contrast, increased glial density indicated by increased
	mIns and decreased neuronal density indicated by the decreased tNA,
	were only observed in NAWM of typical CDMS patients with white matter
